In Spring 2025, I'm taking a Quantitative Reasoning class focused on R programming and data science. Here's a collection of my project work that demonstrates my growing expertise in data analysis and visualization.

## [Building a Data Science Portfolio](https://github.com/kiara-gleiser/your-repo)

This project showcases my ability to:

-   Create and deploy a professional portfolio website using Quarto and GitHub Pages
-   Implement version control best practices with Git
-   Write clear, well-documented R code for data analysis
-   Structure and present technical content for different audiences
-   Develop a professional online presence for data science work

The complete source code is available in the linked GitHub repository, demonstrating my commitment to open-source development and reproducible research practices.

## Lab Projects - ESS 330 Quantitative Reasoning for Ecosystem Science

### Lab 2: Minnesota Tree Growth Analysis

```

This lab focused on data manipulation using dplyr. Key learnings included: - Using dplyr verbs for data transformation - Understanding pipe operations and data flow - Grouping and summarizing data - Working with time series data - Analyzing tree growth patterns

### Lab 3: COVID Wrangling

From this lab, I learned several important concepts about analyzing COVID-19 data:

-   The importance of public data access for understanding disease spread and making informed decisions
-   How to calculate and visualize per capita rates to better understand disease impact across different population sizes
-   The concept of Weighted Mean Center (WMC) and how it can be used to track the geographic movement of disease spread
-   How to create effective visualizations that combine multiple data aspects (location, time, and magnitude)
-   The value of comparing different metrics (cases vs. deaths) to understand different aspects of the pandemic's impact
-   How to use R for spatial data analysis and visualization, including working with geographic coordinates and creating maps

The lab demonstrated how data science and visualization techniques can be applied to understand complex public health issues and track their evolution over time and space.
