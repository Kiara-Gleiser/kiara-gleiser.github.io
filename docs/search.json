Key learnings included: - Using dplyr verbs for data transformation - Understanding pipe operations and data flow - Grouping and summarizing data - Working with time series data - Analyzing tree growth patterns\n\n\nLab 3: COVID Wrangling\n\nFrom this lab, I learned several important concepts about analyzing COVID-19 data:\n\nThe importance of public data access for understanding disease spread and making informed decisions\nHow to calculate and visualize per capita rates to better understand disease impact across different population sizes\nThe concept of Weighted Mean Center (WMC) and how it can be used to track the geographic movement of disease spread\nHow to create effective visualizations that combine multiple data aspects (location, time, and magnitude)\nThe value of comparing different metrics (cases vs. deaths) to understand different aspects of the pandemic’s impact\nHow to use R for spatial data analysis and visualization, including working with geographic coordinates and creating maps\n\nThe lab demonstrated how data science and visualization techniques can be applied to understand complex public health issues and track their evolution over time and space."
